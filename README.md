## Features

- **AI-Powered Data Extraction**: Extract structured data from web pages using natural language queries
- **CSS Selector Generation**: Generate CSS selectors for web elements based on natural language descriptions
- **XPath Generation**: Generate XPath expressions for web elements based on natural language descriptions
- **Supports Multiple Query Types**: Use either natural language or structured GraphQL-like queries

## Installation

```bash
# Install and run
npm i @constellix/ai-scraper-mcp

# Set your API key as an environment variable
GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

MCP configurations:
```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "ai-scraper":{
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
                "-y",
                "@constellix/ai-scraper-mcp"
            ],
            "env": {
                "GEMINI_API_KEY" : "YOUR_API_KEY"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Then in your MCP-compatible client (Claude, Cursor, etc.), you can use the ai-scraper tools to extract data from websites.

}
```

## Query Types

### Natural Language Queries

Examples:
- "List all the products on the page"
- "Find the main navigation menu"
- "Extract all blog post titles and their publication dates"

### Structured Queries (GraphQL-like)

```
{
  products_list[]{
    product_name,
    product_price,
    product_image
  }
}
```

You can also specify data types or add natural language descriptions:

```
{
  products_list[]{
    product_name (string),
    product_price (number),
    product_image (string)
  }
}
```

Or with descriptions:

```
{
  products_list (products made out of cotton)[]{
    product_name,
    product_price,
    product_image
  }
}
```
